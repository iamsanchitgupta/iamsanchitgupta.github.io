                        Sanchit is a friend and mentor to me. He shared prep tips with me during my intern interviews and
                        answered any questions I had regarding the interview process. Once I got my intern, he motivated
                        me to practice for conversion interviews a month before the intern started. I used to share update
                        on my progress everyday and he celebrated every achievement we made along the way; be it me
                        performing well in a coding contest or me reaching a milestone in leetcode. Besides, we sometimes
                        joke around/ play scribble and among us together.

                        I was introduced to Sanchit by a very good friend of mine. It was at a time when I was working hard
                        on improving my technical skills. I somewhere knew that not being from those elite colleges might be
                        an obstacle to the opportunities that come my way. Sanchit helped me in preparing the right way,
                        making sure that I'm on the correct track. He helped me push the limits and realize my potential. It
                        was with his help that I was able to get the opportunities I deserved based on my skills. I'm just
                        one example. Sanchit guides and mentors so many other students this way, besides doing his own work.
                        He also aims to bridge the gender gap in the technical field by helping more women in technology to
                        get into this industry. I wish him all the luck and success in this endeavour.

                        Sanchit has been doing a great job mentoring and helping us to achieve our dreams. He has been guiding us
                        on how to prepare for big companies, how to ace interviews and also how not to be disappointed if we get
                        rejection. His story is a great inspiration and I personally have got huge motivations when I got
                        rejection in some companies. Eventually I could bag some good offers and I can say Sanchit has an important
                        contribution in that. He is not just a wonderful mentor but also a great friend. He encourages us to play
                        games, shares memes and other fun stuff with us time to time so that we do not loose our sanity while
                        preparing XD.

                        have regarding the guidance he provide. He makes sure that the things are not monotonous, to make
                        sure of that he keeps sharing memes, any kind of post which could help. He takes updates every
                        week which keep us consistent, he lets us know if there is any kind of improvement we can make.
                        He is very particular when it comes to formate in which we have to give weekly updates, which too
                        helps us. He is a great mentor and he makes sure that people are comfortable enough to share their
                        problems and clear any kind of doubt.

                        <b>24 Dec, 2020:</b> Hello, everyone! I'm Nishit Attrey, an upcoming intern at Google. It was indeed
                        a dream come true for me to get an internship offer from Google, which was all possible due to
                        Sanchit's excellent mentorship and guidance. He has always been very supportive throughout the process
                        and always instilled confidence in me that I can crack this internship. It was just not his referral
                        that made a difference for me but it was his support from the point of application until the interviews
                        that really guided my preparation in the right direction and ultimately helped me to secure this
                        internship. It was indeed a great experience for me to have Sanchit as my mentor who helped me to
                        achieve this dream internship.

                        <b>24 Dec, 2020:</b> Sanchit has worked a lot to mentor students from multiple colleges. In my personal
                        experience, I approached him asking for guidance, and he helped me from that day onwards. He used to
                        check my weekly reports on how my coding is going and as per the needs, he suggested ways to improve.
                        There was a point in my preparation when I was getting rejections that time his motivative words helped
                        me to trust myself and keep trying. Afterwards, I received two offers, one for 6th months internship and
                        another for full time.

                        when i was in demotivated phase of my life , when i was not knowing how will i be able to cope up with
                        competetive programming my friend told me about Sanchit who is not only my mentor but also an inspiration
                        for me. Being mentored by him ,i learnt the value of discipline as i started practicing daily to give him
                        update which not only helped me in improving my competetive skills but also helped me in gaining confidence
                        within me. All i can say he is truly a brilliant person and a motivator for me with a good sense of humor.
                        Not spamming the group is the basic rule of our group. All i could say if he would have not been there in
                        my life , i would have said goodbye to competetive programming ,so thankyou so much Sanchit for existing
                        and for always guiding and for always helping us in reaching towards our desired goals.

                        <b>24 Dec, 2020:</b>
                        Greetings to everyone reading this.
                        I am Rasam Anand, BTech final year student from NIT Jalandhar. I have been in contact with Sanchit for
                        about last 6-8 months now and I have never seen anyone dedicated so much and putting this much efforts
                        in reducing gender gap in Tech and motivating every person in his contact to give their best. He makes
                        you realise your potential and scolds you in case you are not doing to the level you could for your own
                        good. I am an introvert person and couldn't get frank easily to anyone due to which I have very rarely
                        been able to talk to him but despite of that he has always been a source of inspiration through his
                        constant messages, videos he keeps sharing with all and sometimes his answers to queries by other members
                        of group. Being available anytime and putting so much efforts taking out time from in his own busy life
                        is something I like the most about him. He is a really great mentor. Hats-off to his sincere efforts.

                        Sanchit is astounding! Everything you want is a great mentor and at the same time, a good counselor
                        when you feel like going nowhere. He is one of a kind with an urge to help the students with a strong
                        focus on bringing down the substantial gender gap in tech. He is an incredible guy always motivating
                        amidst the daily hiccups, often sharing memes and playing online games. Sanchit is helping several
                        students throughout India to begin their career in tech. I will definitely be happy to see him becoming
                        a part of more such endeavors for the community. Thank you!

                        my mistakes, polish my resume and motivated me towards my career in tech. His views on feminism and
                        the work done by him for women in tech is truly exemplary! He is a mentor, a friend and a warehouse
                        of preposterous jokes! :)"

                        daily practice. It helped me get a good rank on coding contests and solve a lot of questions on
                        Leetcode. I have solved more than 800 questions on Leetcode and hold an Expert rating on Codeforces.
                        He assisted me to rise from my fails and relieving stress by playing Among Us and Scribble. I
                        would not have reached this level without his consistent efforts he played the role of an advisor,
                        mentor and counsellor throughout for me.

                        Sanchit was a huge help in me securing a job at Google. He gave me a referral, and could have stopped
                        there as most do. However, he provided invaluable guidance about all parts of the process, discussed
                        at length the merits and demerits of applying to various locations and went above and beyond by
                        following up with the recruiters. He was also extremely helpful during the entire interview process,
                        always ready to answer any and all queries. Apart from this, he also tried very hard to land me an
                        nternship at Google the previous year, even though we were well past the deadline for applications.
                        Overall, I'm extremely grateful to Sanchit for everything he did over the past few years.

                        Sanchit was the first senior with whom I interacted during my undergraduate. Since then, he has been
                        super helpful to me throughout my studies, whether it be advise on approaching professors for projects,
                        to career advice, interview tips and reviewing application materials, he has been incredibly gracious
                        in helping me out through it all. Even after graduation, he kept in touch, and was ever ready to help
                        me prepare for various opportunities, providing references as well as connecting me with other
                        professionals to expand my network. In fact, the biggest reason that I am currently working as a
                        Microsoft Intern, is because of Sanchit's referral. He is a gem of a person, and his technical as well
                        as worldly knowledge is something that has always inspired me. I feel blessed to have come to know him!"

                        Hello everyone, I am Ishapreet Kaur, from NIT, Kurukshetra. Being from non-CS background it's very
                        difficult for someone to even think about to crack any software job or internship, similar case was
                        with me as my branch is ECE , I was very confused like what to study, how to start then luckily I
                        came to know about Sanchit, I told him everything then he gave me whole roadmap like what to study,
                        which things you have to follow, how to practice data structures and algorithms, which platforms you
                        have to follow for coding practice. And along with that he also asked me to give him weekly updates
                        regarding my preparation. Along with this, Sanchit also helps the students by providing them refferal
                        in Google and as well as in other good companies. As a mentor, he guides you so well that sooner or
                        later with constant efforts you'll be able to crack great job. I personally learnt so many things
                        under his guidance and I must say that he's doing great efforts by helping many students to achieve
                        their dreams.

                        Thank you.

                        Sanchit is my college senior. However, we didn't know each other until two years after he graduated, when
                        he helped me with a Google referral. Despite our lack of friendship, Sanchit left no stone unturned to make
                        sure the G recruitment process works out for me.

                        Most people would refer you on their company portal, and that's it - but Sanchit reviewed and improved my
                        resume, actively talked to recruiters, hiring managers, and even directors to make sure I get the interviews,
                        gave valuable tips on how to prepare for and perform in the interviews and, thanks to him, I ended up
                        clearing the hiring committee. He also retrieved regular updates for my application when team matching took
                        an unprecedented turn due to COVID and discussed with me my options so I can start my career just right.

                        If you can tolerate his terrible puns and memes, Sanchit is a caring person who leaves his own interests
                        behind, wishes the best for you & tries his best to make that happen."

                        <b>24 Dec, 2020:</b> Sanchit helped me during my Google internship interview preparation by telling me
                        to practice Leetcode questions and doing contests. After the Google internship was over, I did not get a
                        PPO and was getting rejected from company after company. I was really lost and messaged him out of the
                        blue. He motivated me a lot and gave me an action plan. I will be forever be grateful to him that he did
                        not give me sympathy or tell me everything will be ok. Instead, he helped me plan out the next steps so
                        that I could achieve my goals. He told me to give contests on Codeforces. I started giving contests on
                        Leetcode, AtCoder, Codeforces, CodeChef
                        I was to give him weekly updates as well. Since, I had already done a good number of questions from
                        leetcode and knew the concepts, he told me to give as many contests as possible to improve my speed and
                        accuracy. Giving contests helped me solve problems under pressure and boosted my confidence. He correctly
                        identified my weaknesses and gave me guidance to improve upon them. He is a kind, sharp and inspiring human
                        and anyone would be luck to receive guidance from him :)
